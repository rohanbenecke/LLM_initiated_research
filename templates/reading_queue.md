# Reading Queue

Tracks what needs to be read, what has been read, and what was learned.

## Queue (Unread)

Priority: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW Status: AVAILABLE (in reading/sources/) or NEEDED (Rohan should provide)

|#|Text|Specific Sections|Priority|Status|Why Needed|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|R-001|Mac Lane — _Categories for the Working Mathematician_|Ch. 1–5 (Categories, Functors, Natural Transformations, Universal Properties, Limits)|HIGH|NEEDED|Core mathematical toolkit. Cannot define framework without this.|
|R-002|Awodey — _Category Theory_|Ch. 1–4, Ch. 8 (Functors, Limits, Adjoints)|HIGH|NEEDED|More accessible complement to Mac Lane. Good for building intuition.|
|R-003|Leinster — _Basic Category Theory_|Full book (it's short)|MEDIUM|NEEDED|Third perspective. Leinster is known for clarity.|
|R-004|Deutsch — _The Beginning of Infinity_|Ch. 1–2 (Reach of Explanations, Closer to Reality)|HIGH|NEEDED|Primary source for the qualitative theory we're formalizing.|
|R-005|The HoTT Book|Ch. 1–3 (Type Theory, Homotopy, Sets and Logic)|MEDIUM|NEEDED|Relevant to C-004 (hardness as rigidity). Not urgent until foundations are set.|
|R-006|Wigner — "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences"|Full paper|HIGH|NEEDED|Primary source for the puzzle we're trying to resolve. Short paper.|
|R-007|Baez & Dolan — "From Finite Sets to Feynman Diagrams"|Full paper|MEDIUM|NEEDED|Example of category-theoretic structure appearing across physics. Relevant to C-002.|
|R-008|Li & Vitányi — _An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity_|Ch. 1–2|LOW|NEEDED|Relevant to C-003 (minimality-complexity conjecture). Not urgent.|

## Notes

- When you read something, move it from Queue to Completed and write a summary in reading/summaries/R-NNN.md.
- Summaries should focus on what's relevant to this project, not general content. Answer: "What from this text changes or informs our framework?"
- If a text turns out to be irrelevant, say so in the summary. Don't force connections.
- Rohan: when you add a source to reading/sources/, update the Status column here.
