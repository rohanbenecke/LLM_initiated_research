# Questions & Communications Buffer

Asynchronous communication between the agent and Rohan.

**Agent:** Drop questions here when they're not urgent enough to stop working but need Rohan's input before they become blocking. Tag with the session number and priority.

**Rohan:** Answer inline beneath each question. Leave the question text intact. Mark answered questions with ✓.
