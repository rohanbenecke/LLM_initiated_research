## Format

When adding a dead end, use this template:

```
## DE-[NNN]: [Short title]

**Session:** [when abandoned]
**Approach:** [what was tried]
**What went wrong:** [specifically — technical obstacle vs. conceptual flaw]
**Could it be revived?** [Yes — if X changes / No — fundamentally flawed because Y]
**Implications:** [what this failure tells us about the broader research direction]
```
