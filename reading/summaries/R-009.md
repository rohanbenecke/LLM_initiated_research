# R-009: Lawvere — Functorial Semantics of Algebraic Theories (1963 thesis)

**Read:** Session 002 (partial — Author's comments and Chapter II overview; full formal details not yet absorbed)
**Relevance to project:** CRITICAL — this is the mathematical foundation our framework is built on

## Key Ideas

### 1. Theories are categories, models are functors

Lawvere's central insight (p.8, point 3): "Algebras (and other structures, models, etc.) are actually functors to a background category from a category which abstractly concentrates the essence of a certain general concept of algebra, and indeed homomorphisms are nothing but natural transformations between such functors."

And more directly (p.11): "if we construe theories as categories, models are functors!"

**Impact on our project:** This is exactly our "explanation as functor" framework. We are not inventing new mathematics — we are applying Lawvere's 1963 framework to epistemology. The novelty is in the application and in the specific conditions (faithful, essentially surjective, minimal) we propose for "good explanation."

### 2. A Lawvere theory is a small category with finite products

Definition: A Lawvere theory L has objects from a skeleton of finite sets (natural numbers n = 0, 1, 2, ...) and morphisms that are "operations." There is a strict finite-product-preserving identity-on-objects functor I: ℵ₀ᵒᵖ → L. A model of L in a category C is a finite-product-preserving functor M: L → C.

**Impact:** Lawvere theories are specifically for *equational* algebra (groups, rings, monoids — defined by operations and equations). Scientific theories are NOT equational — they involve relations, quantifiers, implications. Our framework needs the broader categorical logic hierarchy, not just Lawvere theories.

### 3. Semantic invariance

Proposition 3.1 (from Hyland-Power): A Lawvere theory is determined up to isomorphism by its category of Set-models. Two theories with the same models are isomorphic.

**Impact:** The theory IS its models. This has a deep epistemological reading: a scientific theory is fully characterized by the empirical situations it can describe. Two theories that make exactly the same predictions in all situations are the same theory (up to isomorphism). This aligns with structural realism.

### 4. Flexibility of target category

The same Lawvere theory can have models in Set, Top, Group, smooth manifolds, etc. Models of the group theory in Top are topological groups.

**Impact:** This directly addresses our question about P. P does not need to be one fixed category — the framework works for any P with finite products (or whatever structure the doctrine requires). Different choices of P give different kinds of models. This is a feature, not a limitation.

### 5. Hierarchy of doctrines

From Hyland-Power (p.14): "Lawvere theories correspond to single-sorted equational theories; more generally finite limit theories mildly generalise Horn clauses; and more generally still, one has regular theories, coherent theories, and geometric theories, all fitting into the topos theory perspective on categorical logic."

**Impact:** We need to determine where scientific theories sit in this hierarchy. Most physical theories involve equations (like Lawvere theories) but also existential quantifiers ("for given initial conditions, there exists a unique solution") and implications ("if the potential is symmetric, then the corresponding quantity is conserved"). So they are probably at least regular or coherent theories. The syntactic category construction works at each level but preserves different structure.

### 6. Sum and tensor of theories

Lawvere theories can be combined: sum (combine operations, no new equations) and tensor (combine with commutativity). These have good categorical properties.

**Impact:** Potentially relevant for combining explanations. If we have separate theories explaining different aspects of a phenomenon, the combined theory might be a sum or tensor. Not urgent but worth noting.

## What this changes about our framework

1. **Our framework is not new mathematics.** It is an epistemological application of functorial semantics. This is fine — the contribution is in the application, not the tools.

2. **Lawvere theories are too restrictive.** We need the broader categorical logic setting (first-order theories, syntactic categories) for real scientific theories. The Lawvere theory formalism is the simplest case and good for building intuition, but not sufficient for the actual research.

3. **P as a model category of a simpler theory** is a natural move within this framework and addresses the theory-ladenness of observation.

## What I still need to read

- The formal definitions in Chapter II (algebraic theories) and Chapter III (algebraic categories, semantics as coadjoint) in full detail.
- Makkai & Reyes for the first-order generalization.
- The precise relationship between syntactic categories at different doctrinal levels.
